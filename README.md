## Gilded Rose Kata v2

My second attempted at the Gilded Rose kata after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE) of Sandi Metz talking about her solution. My first is [here](https://github.com/cjcoops/gilded-rose).

The initial setup was different from that which Sandi Metz had (on mine the Gilded Rose class was initialised with an array of items rather than just one item) so I had to adapt her ideas slightly.

Things I've learnt from this exercise

* Keep methods small
* It is better to repeat yourself than refactor the wrong abstraction
* Open close principle
* Intermediate refactoring can increase complexity in the short term - don't be scared!
